# Nmap MCP Server

> **Disclaimer:** This is a personal project, and still a work in progress, and is not intended for production in real environments. Use at your own risk!

Dockerized Kali Linux container that exposes Nmap scanning as a very small and lightweight [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tool for AI agents.

## Architecture

```
AI Client (Claude, opencode, etc.)
    │  MCP protocol (stdio)
    ▼
Docker Container (kalilinux/kali-rolling)
    │
    ├── uv         (Python package manager)
    ├── server.py  (FastMCP server)
    │       ├── @mcp.tool()  →  nmap_scan(target, flags, ports)
    │       └── @mcp.tool()  →  ping_scan(target)
    └── nmap
```

## Quick Start

Build the new image, then edit your AI configuration file in order to use it with your agent. See below for configuration example.

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Build the Docker image

```bash
# Build the image
docker build --target base -t nmap-mcp-server .

# Or run (stdio-based MCP server) for testing
docker run --rm -it nmap-mcp-server
```

### Configure your Agent

Add to your MCP client config (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` or `opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nmap-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "nmap-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Optionally verify Connection

Test the server manually using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector docker run -i --rm nmap-mcp-server
```

## Usage examples

### 1. Quick Discovery (Ping Scan)

Find live hosts on a local subnet before performing a deeper scan.

- **Prompt to Agent:** "Scan the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet and tell me which devices are online."
- **Agent Action:** Calls `ping_scan(target="192.168.1.0/24")`.

### 2. Detailed Service Enumeration

Identify the specific versions of software running on open ports.

- **Prompt to Agent:** "Check what services are running on 10.0.0.50. I need to know the exact versions."
- **Agent Action:** Calls `nmap_scan(target="10.0.0.50", flags="-sV")`.

### 3. Security Audit (Port Range)

Perform a stealthy scan on a specific range of ports to identify vulnerabilities.

- **Prompt to Agent:** "Perform a stealth SYN scan on scanme.nmap.org for ports 1 to 1000."
- **Agent Action:** Calls `nmap_scan(target="scanme.nmap.org", flags="-sS", ports="1-1000")`.

### 4. Agentic Workflow: "The Recon Loop"

AI agents can chain these tools together in a single conversation:

1.  **Discover**: Use `ping_scan` to find a target.
2.  **Scan**: Use `nmap_scan` to find open ports.
3.  **Analyze**: The agent interprets the `stdout` and suggests next steps based on the `security-researcher` persona.

## Development

```bash
# Mount local source for hot-reload
./run_dev.sh
```

The `src/` directory is volume-mounted so code changes take effect without rebuilding.

Or run directly:

```bash
cd src
uv sync
uv run server.py
```

## Security

- Nmap runs inside a disposable container — no persistent access to the host
- Always verify you have authorization before scanning targets
- Default timeout: 5 minutes

## Known Limitations & TODOs

- **Flag allowlist** — `flags` param currently accepts any Nmap flag. Should be restricted to a safe set (e.g., `-sV`, `-O`, `-A`, `-T4`, `-sC`, `-Pn`).
- **Target validation** — No validation that target is a valid IP/hostname. `target: "-oN /tmp/x"` would execute unexpectedly.
- **`flags` and `ports` can conflict** — Passing `-p` in both can produce unexpected behavior since Nmap uses the last `-p` value.
- **Timeout not configurable** — Hardcoded at 300s; should be a tool parameter.
- **No GitHub Actions CI** — Tests exist but aren't run automatically.
- **`CmdExec` class** — Could be replaced with a simpler `subprocess.run()` call. However, as this project could grow in the future. It's worth to keep the code.
- **Docker `--init` flag** — Not used; child processes may not be properly reaped.

## Dependencies

- `mcp[cli]>=1.27.0`
- `pytest>=9.0.3` (dev)
